# Third-party notices

osxEQL is open source. The distributable bundle contains binaries built from the
following open-source projects, plus it runs (but does **not** include) a
copyrighted game. Each is listed with its license and where to get the
corresponding source — this is how osxEQL satisfies the LGPL.

## Wine (from CrossOver sources) — LGPL-2.1

The `Wine/` runtime shipped in the app is compiled **by this project** from
CodeWeavers' officially published CrossOver source tarball (the LGPL source drop),
with the system compiler and no proprietary components. It contains **no**
D3DMetal, no CrossOver GUI, and no CrossOver branding.

- License: GNU LGPL v2.1 (see https://www.winehq.org/license).
- Corresponding source: `crossover-sources-<version>.tar.gz` from
  https://media.codeweavers.com/pub/crossover/source/ (the exact version is pinned
  in `engine/build-wine.sh`, currently CrossOver 26.2.0).
- Build recipe (how to reproduce our binary): `engine/build-wine.sh`.
- You may obtain, modify, rebuild, and relink the Wine runtime under the LGPL.

## DXMT — LGPL-2.1-or-later

The Direct3D 11 → Metal translation layer. Builtin DLLs (`d3d11`, `d3d10core`,
`dxgi`, `winemetal`) + `winemetal.so` are shipped from the project's release.

## EverQuest Legends client — NOT included, Daybreak property

osxEQL ships **no** game files. The EverQuest / EverQuest Legends client, the
`EQLegends_setup.exe` installer, the LaunchPad, and all game assets are the
property of Daybreak Game Company (or its successors). You must obtain them
yourself, from the official source, with a legitimate account. osxEQL only runs a
copy you install yourself; it does not redistribute, modify, or circumvent any
protection on the game.

This project is an unofficial, fan-made compatibility tool and is not affiliated
with, endorsed by, or supported by Daybreak Game Company, CodeWeavers, or Apple.

## Modifications to the Wine runtime (osxEQL-Buddy / osxEQL-Companion)

The Wine runtime shipped by osxEQL-Companion (identical to osxEQL-Buddy's) is CodeWeavers' source with two changes, both
published here as source (LGPL-2.1, like Wine): the winemac.drv overlay patch below
(`engine/patches/winemac-overlay.patch`) and the winecoreaudio.drv "follow the default
output" change (`engine/patches/coreaudio-follow-default.py`, which edits
`dlls/winecoreaudio.drv/coreaudio.c`). `engine/build-wine.sh` applies both; `engine/overlay.sh`
and `engine/audiofix.sh` rebuild the two affected libraries.

## EQBuddy winemac overlay patch — MIT

`engine/patches/winemac-overlay.patch` (applied to the Wine runtime by
`engine/overlay.sh` and `engine/build-wine.sh`) comes from EQBuddy 1.99.18,
`scripts/crossover/winemac-overlay.patch`; `engine/overlay.sh` follows that
release's `scripts/crossover/setup-overlay.sh`, and `engine/tools/winlevels.m`
(`osxeql winlevels`) is that release's `scripts/crossover/winlevels.m`.

EQ Legends Companion (https://github.com/jmoyers/everquest-companion, © Josh Moyers,
FSL-1.1-MIT) is a separate program that osxEQL-Companion does not include or
redistribute; `engine/eqlcompanion.sh` downloads its official release on request,
verifies it against the SHA-512 in the release's `latest.yml`, and runs it unmodified.
