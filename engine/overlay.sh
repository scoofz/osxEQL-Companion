# Let the companion's overlays (any opted-in topmost window) float over the FULLSCREEN game.
#
# Why: when EQ runs fullscreen, macOS puts its window at a level no ordinary
# topmost window can beat, so the companion's windows disappear behind it (they only
# shows again once the game goes windowed). engine/patches/winemac-overlay.patch
# adds an opt-in per-app knob to winemac.drv (LetTopmostWindowsFloatOverFullscreen)
# that lifts such a window above the fullscreen level. engine/eqlcompanion.sh writes
# that knob for the companion's exe before it starts. (Patch from EQBuddy 1.99.18, MIT.)
#
# This rebuilds ONLY winemac.so — from the same CodeWeavers CrossOver source the
# runtime was built from (engine/build-wine.sh), plus the patch — and swaps it into
# the Wine runtime(s) in place, keeping a backup. Minutes, not the full 30-60 min
# build. Nothing prebuilt is downloaded; the patch is readable in engine/patches/.
#
#   engine/overlay.sh            patch the runtime(s)
#   engine/overlay.sh --revert   restore the original winemac.so
#   engine/overlay.sh --status   show whether each runtime is patched
#
# Runtimes touched: $WINE_DIR (the engine's) and the installed app's (osxEQL-Companion.app, osxEQL-Buddy.app or osxEQL.app) embedded
# one — each only once if one is a symlink to the other. An .app is re-signed
# ad-hoc afterwards (editing a bundle file breaks its signature).
# Requires: Xcode command-line tools, and bison >= 3 (brew install bison).
# Shared build plumbing: engine/driverlib.sh (also used by engine/audiofix.sh).
